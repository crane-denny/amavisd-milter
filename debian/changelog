    - Rewrote some parts of the init script to make the code more error
      resistant (thanks to Gabor Kiss for the initial bug report and Teodor
      Micu and Agustin Martin for the valuable help).
      Closes: #609762: amavisd-milter: Init script changes owner of current
                       directory to 'amavis'
  * debian/amavisd-milter.default:

      simplifying patch exchange (thanks to Paul Wise and Charles Plessy for
      the the valuable help).
